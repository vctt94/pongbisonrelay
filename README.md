# Pong on Bison Relay

A fast, privacy-friendly Pong with self custodial bets, built on the Bison Relay network.

**Self‚Äëcustodial** with **Schnorr adaptor signatures**. You fund your own escrow pkscript, bet and play.

## Why this is different

- **Self‚Äëcustodial escrow** ‚Äì You fund a **script you control** (P2SH). The server never holds your funds.
- **Schnorr adaptor settlement** ‚Äì Matches resolve by revealing a secret embedded in a final Schnorr signature, unlocking the winner‚Äôs payout without giving custody to anyone in the middle.
- **Safety valve (CSV timeout)** ‚Äì If settlement stalls, the redeem script includes a **CSV** (relative timelock) refund path so you can reclaim funds.
- **Privacy by design** ‚Äì Bison Relay RPC authentication with payment and messages over an end‚Äëto‚Äëend, censorship‚Äëresistant network.

## Feature Highlights

- üèì Real‚Äëtime Pong (Terminal UI with Bubble Tea, or Flutter UI)
- üí∏ Escrow‚Äëbacked betting in DCR
- üéØ Waiting rooms & matchmaking by stake
- üîî In‚Äëapp notifications

## How it works (plain English)

1. **Create your self‚Äëescrow.** The client derives a redeem script from **your public key** and safety params (e.g., **CSV** blocks). It shows a **script address (P2SH)** for you to fund.
2. **Fund it.** Send DCR to that address. The bot sees your funding tx (mempool or after N confirms‚Äîpolicy dependent) and marks your escrow ‚Äúready.‚Äù
3. **Join or create a waiting room.** Rooms are grouped by the **stake** available in your escrow.
4. **Play the match.** First to 3 points wins.
5. **Settlement via Schnorr adaptor.** The winner learns a secret (Œ≥) from the final signature and uses it to unlock the payout from the escrow script.
6. **Timeout fallback.** If something goes wrong, you can reclaim funds after the CSV timeout with your own key.

> **Self‚Äëcustody note:** If you see a ‚Äúdeposit address,‚Äù it‚Äôs a **script address you control**. The server cannot move your funds. The script is constructed from **your** key and rules you can verify.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.22+
- Bison Relay client running with RPC enabled (brclient or bruig)
- (Optional) Flutter if you want the GUI

### Build

**Bot (referee & API)**
```bash
go build -o pongbot ./cmd/pongbot
```

**Terminal Client**
```bash
go build -o pongclient ./cmd/pongclient
```

**Flutter UI**
```bash
cd pongui
# See detailed steps in pongui/README.md
```

### Run

**Start the server (bot):**
```bash
./pongbot
```

**Start the terminal client:**
```bash
./pongclient
```

**Start the Flutter UI:**
```bash
cd pongui
# run via Flutter tooling (see pongui/README.md)
```

## Minimal Configuration

Your Bison Relay RPC must be enabled and reachable. On first run, each component creates a config file with defaults that you can edit.

- **Bot config:** `{appdata}/.pongbot/pongbot.conf`  
- **Terminal client config:** `{appdata}/.pongclient/pongclient.conf`  
- **Flutter client config:** `{appdata}/.pongui/pongui.conf`

## Funding your self‚Äëescrow (what you‚Äôll see)

1. Client shows a **script address (P2SH)**.  
2. You **send DCR** to it (any wallet).  
3. Bot detects your funding tx and marks your escrow as **available stake**.  
4. You can now **enter rooms** that match your available stake.

> The redeem script: **P2SH(pk, CSV)** ‚Äî spend path (winner via adaptor‚Äërevealed secret) and a **refund path** after CSV with your own key.

---

## Gameplay

1. Fund your escrow pkscript (above).
2. Create or join a waiting room that matches your available stake.
3. Ready up. When both players are ready, the match starts.
4. Controls: **W/S** or **‚Üë/‚Üì**.
5. First to **3** points wins. Winner unlocks the escrow payout.

---

## Betting & Safety

- **Minimum Stake:** set by the bot (`minbetamt`, default `0.00000001 DCR`).  
- **Free‚Äëto‚ÄëPlay:** `isf2p=true` uses simulated escrows for testing.  
- **CSV Timeout:** protects you if settlement is delayed; you can refund after the relative timelock.  
- **Connectivity:** confirm your Bison Relay client is connected before playing.

## FAQ

**If funds are self‚Äëcustodial, why do I see a ‚Äúdeposit address‚Äù?**  
That‚Äôs a **script address you control** (P2SH). The redeem script is built from **your** public key and safety parameters (like a **CSV** timeout). It‚Äôs not a server wallet.

**How does Schnorr adaptor settlement work here?**  
Before the match, the protocol prepares signatures so that the final winner‚Äôs signature **reveals a secret (Œ≥)**. Knowing Œ≥ lets the winner satisfy the script‚Äôs spend path and unlock the payout‚Äî**without** giving the server custody of anyone‚Äôs funds.
You can see more about it [here](https://victorduarte.site/blog/schnorr/)

**What if settlement fails?**  
Wait the configured **CSV** period, then use the refund path with your key to reclaim your funds.
